## Description
This project represents the Front End Capstone series of the Hack Reactor
Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp program. With a vision to create a dynamic web app
that would faciliate e-commerce in a novel way, Shloka, Thinh, and Joel prepared this app
with two goals in mind, complexity and beauty. The fine balance of these values gave us
an app which provides a complex UI and UX while still being accessible and meaningful
to everyday users. The result is a webpage which provides users with detailed information
about a product, and access to stats and feedback from other purchasers to complement it.
Product comparisons are allowed and outfits allow customers to mix and match different
styles. Users can shop with confidence knowing the app gives them reliable feedback to
inform their purchase decision.

## Installation Steps
1. Download a local copy of this repository.
1. If you're already using Node.js v16.14.0, great! Our project uses this version.
  - If you dont have this version, we recommend using nvm (node version manager). It makes switching
  to Node.js v16.14.0 much easier.
    - Follow this link for steps on installing nvm. https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md
    - In the terminal, run `nvm install 16.14.0` to install Node.
    - In the terminal, run `npm install -g npm` to install npm (node package manager).
    - For more details, follow this link. https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
1. In the terminal, run `npm install` to set up our dependencies.
1. Run the script `react-dev` ("npm run react-dev" in terminal) to start up webpack.
1. Run the script `server-dev` ("npm run server-dev" in terminal) to start up the server.
1. If all goes well, visit localhost:3000 to visit the Home page!

## Usage
This project would be useful in the context of a proposal. It could be an upgrade, modification, or
revamp of an existing webpage. It could also be a sample design provided to client businesses looking
to hire web developers to provide a home page for their business.
